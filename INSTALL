lib_mysqludf_preg  - PCRE functions for mysql
===============================================


== Configuration ==

Most users should be able to simply type ./configure to run the configuration
script.  If mysql is in an unusual place, try: 

./configure --with-mysql=<path to mysql_config>/mysql_config

If libpcre is in an unusual place, try adding:

--with-pcre-prefix=<path to pcre root>



Example  (on macosx with fink)
------------------------------
./configure --with-pcre-prefix=/sw  --with-mysql=/sw/bin/mysql_config

Please use:  ./configure --help to see the other options

Example  (on macosx with MAMP)
------------------------------
Follow the example at the link below to compile Mysql and place the lib files in the correct folders
http://addto.it/Patching-MAMP-2.0.5-to-work-with-Sphinx-2.02

Then configure lib_mysqludf_preg with 
./configure --with-mysql=/Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/mysql_config

== Compile == 
Type make


== Install the library == 
make install

This will install the library in the configured installation directory,
which is defaulted to /usr/local/lib.   For the mysql-5.0 series,
this will need to be in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH of the server.  For the
5.1 series server, this directory needs to be the 'plugin' directory
(and still needs to be in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH) of the server).


== Install the SQL functions == 

make installdb

To uninstall the functions, you can use:  make uninstalldb

== Run some tests ==
make test
